// AJAX : Asynchronous Javascript and XML
// It is a simple web technique
//  Generally : (page refress ho raha tha ek page pe multiple link hai,kisi ko bhi click karne pe(multipage application ))

// Usage => ajax stops reloading ,makes Single page application(SPA)

// Two ways of sending requests => 1.)traditional  2.) AJAX

// ---1.traditional me client sends request to server directly and server send response to client(a HTML+CSS+JS) file, due to which reloading occurs, used in multipage applications

// ---2.AJAX : ishme request is send to server via a JS layer, response is only JS file, (due to absence of HTML+JS file reloading don't occur) -> single page applications are made using AJAX [look one note]

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Data(jo server as a response vejta hai) are of two type
// 1. XML : Extensible MarkUp Language (like html code)
// 2. JSON : Javascript Object Notation (data is like object(not object) : each key of json data is inside double(only not single) quotes compulsorily (key difference between json data and object))

// JSON data is most widely used(i.e on visiting 100 website you will find 98 json and 2 XML)
